# Coding exercises using While loop
"""
You need to create a simple playlist player program in Python that plays songs from a list one by one. 
The program should:
1. Start with the first song in the playlist.
2. After playing a song, ask the user for input: repeat, next, stop
3. If the user types repeat, play the same song again.
4. If the user types next, move on to the next song.
5. If the user types stop, end the program immediately.
6. If the user types anything else, print an error message asking for a valid command.
7. When the playlist reaches the last song and the user chooses next, the program should end with a friendly message.

Use a while loop to control the flow of the playlist.
