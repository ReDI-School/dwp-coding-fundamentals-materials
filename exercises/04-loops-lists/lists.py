# Coding exercises using Lists
"""
You’ve made a weekend to-do list in Python, but it needs a little organizing. Use list operations to solve this exercise.

1. "watch Netflix" isn’t very productive. Replace it with "read a book".
2. You already called your mom. Remove "call mom" from the list.
3. Add "meal prep" and "take a walk" to the end of the list.
4. Move "laundry" to the end of the list (Hint: remove it first, then append it.).
5. Insert "meditate" at the beginning of the list.
6. Create a new list called top_3 that contains the first three tasks from the updated todo list.

# My weekend to-do list
todo = ["laundry", "grocery shopping", "call mom", "watch Netflix", "clean kitchen", "nap"]
