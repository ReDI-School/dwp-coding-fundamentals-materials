# Coding exercises using FOR loop
"""
You're building a simple fitness tracking tool. You want to calculate the total steps you walked over a week using a for loop.
1. Loop through the list and print how many steps you walked each day.
2. Calculate the total number of steps walked in the week using a for loop.
3. Calculate the average steps per day.
4. Print a motivational message for each day where you walked more than 7,000 steps:
Example output: "Great job on Wednesday! You walked 8100 steps!"
(Assume the first day in the list is Monday)
"""

# Steps for each day of the week
daily_steps = [3450, 6890, 7450, 8100, 10200, 4600, 5900]
